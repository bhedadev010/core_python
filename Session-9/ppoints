OOP Features


1) CLASS : Class is a group of different types of variables and functions


2) OBJECT : Object is an instance of class


3) INHERITANCE : -> The object of one class can inherit the properties of object of another class.
                 -> Creating a new class from an existing class.

              Types of inheritance:

               -> Single Inheritance
               -> MultiLevel Inheritance
               -> Multiple Inheritance
               -> Hierarchical Inheritance
               -> Hybrid Inheritance


4) POLYMORPHISM : One name multiple form.  Types of polymorphism:

                -> Compile time polymorphism (Method Overloading): When there is more than one method in same
                                                                   class have same name but with different
                                                                   number of arguments.


                -> Run time polymorphism (Method Over riding) : When there is same method prototype in your
                                                                base class and derived class and if you call
                                                                method using object of derived class then only
                                                                derived class method will be called. In this case
                                                                derived class over rides base class.


5) ABSTRACTION : Only give necessary info and keep everything else


6) ENCAPSULATION : To bind a code and data into a single unit
